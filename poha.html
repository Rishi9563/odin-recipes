    <h2>Masala Poha</h2>
    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups Poha (Flattened rice)</li>
        <li>1 cup Onion , finely chopped</li>
        <li>3/4 cup Fresh coconut, grated</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons Sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder</li>
        <li>1-1/2 teaspoons Coriander Powder (Dhania)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Cumin powder (Jeera)</li>
        <li>Salt, according to your taste</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3><em>Steps</em></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>We make Masala Pohe Recipe by soaking the thick pohe in a bowl with sufficient water for about half a minute and immediately drain and squeeze dry.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, mix together all the above mentioned ingredients except the ones for tempering.</li>
        <li>Check seasoning and sweetness. Add more sugar if desired.</li>
        <li>In the meantime heat a piece of charcoal over direct flame till red ambers are visible. Remove from flame and place in a small bowl which should be kept in the centre of pohe. This is the smoking method and this imparts a unique smoky and earthy flavour to the pohe. Our a few drops of oil over it and shut the pohe with a lid tightly for a minute.</li>
        <li>This imparts a unique smoky flavour to the pohe.</li>
        <li>After the smoking is done, heat oil in a small kadai and add the mustard seeds. When they splutter, add the asafoetida and the turmeric powder.</li>
        <li>Switch off the heat and pour the tempering over the prepared masala pohe. Mix well. This step is optional. Adding it will just bring in more flavour to the poha.</li>
        <li>Serve Masala Pohe Recipe along with Adrak Chai Recipe (Indian Style Ginger Tea ) during tea time. You can garnish it with sev or chivda to make it more appetizing.</li>
    </ol>
